This add on for Property Hive adds the ability for your users to upload home reports to properties

== Description ==

This add on for Property Hive adds the ability for your users to upload home reports to properties, a requirement for properties in Scotland.

== Installation ==

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading the Property Hive Home Reports Add-on plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application.
